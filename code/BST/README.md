## BST
Usage: `[dataFile]  [costFile]  [queryFile]  [height]`
Example: `synthetic.txt bst-cost.txt synthetic_query.txt 9`
- dataFile: the path of source data file
- costFile: the path to store the running cost
- queryFile: the path of input query data file
- height: the height of the tree (we limit the tree-height for fair comparison, which is not necessary for normal use.)
